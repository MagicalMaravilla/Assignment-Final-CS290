Classic Tomato Pasta Recipe
Ingredients:

400g (14 oz) of spaghetti or your favorite pasta
2 tablespoons of olive oil
1 small onion, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
800g (28 oz) of canned whole tomatoes
A handful of fresh basil leaves, torn into small pieces
Salt and pepper, to taste
Parmesan cheese, grated (optional, for serving)
Red chili flakes (optional, for a bit of heat)

Instructions:

Prepare the Pasta:

In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta according to the package instructions until it is al dente. This means the pasta should be tender but still firm to the bite.
Once cooked, drain the pasta, reserving a cup of the pasta water for later. Set the pasta aside.

Start the Tomato Sauce:

While the pasta cooks, heat the olive oil in a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onion and saut√© until translucent and slightly golden, about 5 minutes.
Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant, being careful not to let it burn.

Add Tomatoes:

Pour the canned tomatoes into the skillet. Using a spoon or spatula, break the tomatoes into smaller pieces to help them cook down.
Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste. If you like a bit of spice, this is the perfect time to add a sprinkle of red chili flakes.

Simmer the Sauce:

Lower the heat and let the sauce simmer gently for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sauce will thicken and the flavors will concentrate. 
If the sauce gets too thick, you can add a bit of reserved pasta water to reach a desired consistancy

Combine Pasta and Sauce:

Add the cooked pasta to the skillet with the tomato sauce. Toss everything together well, so the pasta is evenly coated in the sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add a little pasta water to help it cling to the pasta.
Stir in the fresh basil leaves, reserving some for garnish.

Serve:

Serve the pasta hot, garnished with the remaining basil leaves. If you like, sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese over the top for a touch of richness.
