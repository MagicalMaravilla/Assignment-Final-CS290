# Assignment-Final-CS290
recipe page final will include all knowledge obtained

This will be my final project for cs 290

Things to find in my final project so far...

-main page
-profile page
-submit recipe page
-signin page

currently have the css and the html strcure for these pages along with working header links for each of page to ensure that we can get back to all pages without getting a / GET error

I will be implementing much more serverside logic and client side logic, but I am currently just trying to get my html, and css pages correct and lined up so that i can tackle the logic of each page after everything is set up and thought out in a way that would show all the things Ive learned so far, and attempts at things i havent learned
