Ingredients:

1 pound (450g) ground beef (80/20 blend for juiciness)
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon garlic powder
Salt and pepper, to taste
12 mini burger buns or slider buns
1 tablespoon olive oil, for grilling
6 slices of cheddar cheese, cut into quarters (optional, for topping)
1 small red onion, thinly sliced
Pickle slices, as needed
Mustard and ketchup, for serving
Lettuce leaves, torn to fit sliders (optional, for serving)
Tomato slices, optional, for serving
Instructions:

Prepare the Slider Patties:

In a mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mix until just combined. Avoid overmixing to keep the patties tender.
Divide the mixture into 12 equal portions. Shape each portion into a small, flat patty, about the size of your slider buns. Make a small indent in the center of each patty with your thumb to help them cook evenly and stay flat.
Cook the Sliders:

Heat a grill pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Brush with olive oil.
Place the patties on the grill pan. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on one side, then flip. If you're using cheese, place a quarter slice on each patty immediately after flipping.
Cook for an additional 3 minutes for medium doneness. Adjust the cooking time based on your preferred level of doneness.
While the patties are cooking, you can optionally toast the buns cut-side down on the grill pan until lightly golden.
Assemble the Sliders:

Start by placing a small lettuce leaf on the bottom half of each bun (if using). This helps to prevent the bun from getting soggy.
Place a cooked patty on each bottom bun. Top with tomato slices (if using), a few slices of red onion, and pickle slices.
Add mustard and ketchup to the top bun, then place it on top of the sliders.
Secure each slider with a toothpick if necessary to keep everything in place.
Serve:

Serve the sliders immediately while hot. They're perfect for parties, game days, or a fun family dinner.
Sliders are best enjoyed with sides like fries, onion rings, or a simple salad.
